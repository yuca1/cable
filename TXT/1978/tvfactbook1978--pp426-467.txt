Experience
is still the best teacher.
Home Box Office began it all with the first fully programmed pay-cable network over five years ago. And through those years we’ve learned a lot of ways to help individual systems sell HBO—more profitably—to more people.
At the same time, we’ve come up with innovations like satellite delivery bringing broadcast signal quality and ease of interconnect. And with the new 4.5 meter dish, it’s now possible for almost any size cable system to hook up with HBO.
We’ve also come up with some of the most consistently great programming seen anywhere; pay-cable or network.
Significant movies, top sports shows such as “Inside the NFL” and collegiate basketball. Great “On Location” comedy specials and the fresh and lively “Standing Room Only” entertainment series shown only on HBO.
It’s surprisingly easy to put HBO’s experience and performance ability to work for you. Your area General Manager has all the facts ready-and-waiting; just call any time.
